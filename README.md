# Pi_Videoer

A python script to capture images triggered by motion . Uses Raspberry OS BULLSEYE and libcamera-vid.
It will capture videos as still frames, upto 30fps at 1920 x 1080, which can be converted into MP4 files.

lt also captures frames before the trigger frame, default is 2 seconds but settable.

lt has some editing facilities, delete individual frames, delete a series of frames or delete all frames from start or to end of video.

Can make individual mp4s, all mp4s  or a FULL MP4 of frames stored.

Can control focus on a pi v3camera, auto, continuous,  manual or spot.

Frames are captured to /home/user/Pictures, mp4s in /home/user/Videos.

Pi4 recommended, with RaspiOS 64bit. You may need a cooling fan.
